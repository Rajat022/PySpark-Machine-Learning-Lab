# Madrid Airbnb Rental Price Analysis

This project aims to analyze the factors influencing the rental prices of properties on the Madrid Airbnb platform. By examining these factors, we seek to gain insights into the Madrid Airbnb market, provide valuable information to hosts and guests, and contribute to a better understanding of the sharing economy's impact on local housing markets.

Problem Statement

The popularity of Airbnb as an alternative accommodation option has significantly transformed the way people travel. With a wide range of properties available for rent, including apartments, houses, and villas, Airbnb has become an attractive choice for travelers visiting Madrid. However, understanding the key factors that influence rental prices is crucial for both hosts and guests to make informed decisions.
The problem this project addresses is to identify the factors that impact the rental prices of properties on the Madrid Airbnb platform. By conducting a thorough analysis of these factors, we can provide insights into the Madrid Airbnb market and contribute to a broader understanding of the sharing economy's effects on local housing markets.

Objective

The main objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of Madrid Airbnb data to identify the factors that significantly influence rental prices. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to understand the key drivers that impact rental prices and develop a predictive model capable of estimating property rental prices in Madrid.
The insights gained from this analysis can benefit both hosts and guests. Hosts can optimize their pricing strategies based on the identified influential factors, while guests can make more informed decisions about their accommodation choices in Madrid. Furthermore, this study can provide valuable insights into the broader housing market in Madrid and shed light on the potential economic impact of Airbnb on the local economy.

Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset obtained from the Madrid Airbnb platform. This dataset contains various attributes related to the properties listed on Airbnb, such as location, size, amenities, and reviews. It also includes information about the rental prices of the properties.

Methodology

Data Collection: The Madrid Airbnb dataset was obtained from the platform and will be used for analysis.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset will undergo preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming variables, to ensure its suitability for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive EDA will be conducted to gain insights into the distribution of rental prices, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between different variables.

Feature Selection: Relevant features that significantly influence rental prices will be selected based on statistical analysis and domain knowledge.

Machine Learning Modeling: A predictive model will be developed using PySpark and machine learning techniques to estimate rental prices based on the selected features.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the predictive model will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics to measure its accuracy and reliability.

Results and Interpretation: The findings from the analysis, including the identified influential factors and the predictive model's performance, will be presented and interpreted.
